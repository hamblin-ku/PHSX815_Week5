## Homework 5: Rejection Sampling
`rejection_fig.png` contains the results from rejection sampling from a target dsitribution (that happens to be the sum of three different normal distributions). I sampled with a wide normal distribution that I scaled to encompass the entrie target curve. With 10,000 iterations, I achieved an efficiency of 48.9%.

## Usage
The scripts can be ran as:

-`python python/rejection_sampling.py --Niter [# iterations]`
